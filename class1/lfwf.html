<p>The main parts of our element are as follows: The opening tag: This consists of the name of the clement (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing<br>
angle brackets. This states where the element begins or start to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins. The closing tag: This i the same<br>
as the opening tag. except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the<br>
paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results. The content: This is the content of the<br>
element, which in this case, is just text. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag. and the content together comprise the element.
